            <p>Our projects on the natural resources are properly based on the applied climatology (GCM and RCM) for the evaluation of extreme or lowest terminus of climatic parameters. Town management, urban drainage systems, landscape gardening, agricultural farming systems (cereal, vegetative, orchid, ornamental and/or cash crops), environmental hazard assessments, natural waterways flood risk assessments, hydraulic infra-structures (small water harvesting dams, check dams, watershed management practices, water canals, watercourses, bridges and culverts and open channel and closed channel drains) and degraded (salt and/or water logged soil, sliding and erosion) land reclamation strategies are properly planned according to the IPCC (Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change) technical assessment (IPCC: Climate Change 2022: Mitigation of Climate Change Program: Working Group III Report).</p>

            <p>Climate change effects are equally devastating for the planet earth, and it is distinct challenge from the traditional challenges to local, country/states. Governments are adopting regulatory rules those require consideration of potential climate impacts in the public-sector decisions with the goal of improving regional adaptive capacity. Throughout all efforts to mitigate the adverse effects of the climate changes, it is becoming clear that one of the most effective adaptation tools used by the Government is the power to plan residential, commercial, recreational, industrial, agricultural, forest and rangeland regions in the town planning and policy making. Our company has a clear policy to be a part with Govt/ Non Govt, national/ international organizations and private/ public sector agencies for the land use planning and policy making to increase the resiliency to major climate shifts and ensure that our communities are equipped with built-in mechanisms to face and mitigate adverse effects. Moreover, our structural tools and exploring mechanisms help customers to achieve the targeted goals and avoid catastrophic unpreparedness through proper land use.</p>
